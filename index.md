Hello! My name is Gautam Vasudevan Ottur. I'm a linguist — and specifically, a syntactician. I am completing my PhD at the Georg-August Universität Göttingen under [Hedde Zeijlstra](https://www.heddezeijlstra.org/) and [Markus Steinbach](http://www.markus-steinbach.de/). This website mainly serves as a place to keep my handouts, slides, works-in-progress, etc. If you have questions or comments about anything you see here, feel free to shoot me an email at (my first name) [at] (my last name) [dot] info.
