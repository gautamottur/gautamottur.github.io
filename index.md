Hello! My name is Gautam Ottur. I'm a linguist — and specifically, a syntactician. I am completing my PhD at the Georg-August Universität Göttingen under [Hedde Zeijlstra](https://www.heddezeijlstra.org/) and [Markus Steinbach](http://www.markus-steinbach.de/). On this website, you can find information about me and my work. If you have questions or comments about anything you see here, feel free to shoot me an email at (my first name) [at] (my last name) [dot] info.
