# About my name

If you're wondering how I pronounce my name, here's the IPA 🍻: \[ˈgɔt̪əm ˈʋaːsʊˌd̪eːvən ˈoːʈːuːr\]. I'm not bothered when people deviate from this pronunciation, but if you're an English speaker and you would like to approximate it using English phonology, you can try: /ˈgɒθəm ˈvɑsəðeɪvən oʊˈtʊər/. 

*Gautam* is a Hindi name, and *Vasudevan* and *Ottur* are Malayalam names. When using English, I order my names as English names are normally ordered. *Gautam* is my given name, and *Ottur* is the name of my family. *Vasudevan* is an [avonymic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic), which I don't use much.
