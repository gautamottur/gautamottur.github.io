# Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **theoretical syntax** and its interfaces with **phonology, morphology, semantics, and pragmatics**. I investigate how syntactic dependencies interact with other grammatical modules, with a special forcus on **cross-linguistic** and **cross-modal** data (i.e. from **spoken and sign languages**).

## General theoretical focus
### **Syntactic dependencies and locality**  
  I examine the structural conditions that regulate transformations, agreement, and other kinds of redundant dependencies, with a focus on how locality effects emerge from the inherent organization of the memory in syntax, rather than through ancillary mechanisms (CED, phases, etc.).

### **Cross-linguistic variation and typology**  
  Investigating how syntactic structures differ across languages and what these differences reveal about combinatory principles of grammar.

### **Interfaces between syntax and other modules**  
  I seek to understand how the interactions between syntax and phonology, semantics, and pragmatics determines well-formedness, interpretation, and prosodic realization.



## Specific empirical domains
### **Serial verb constructions (SVCs)**  
#### **Research questions:**
  - How do SVCs challenge existing models of syntactic hierarchy and argument structure?  
  - What patterns distinguish SVCs in **Malayalam** and other **head-final** languages?
  - How are SVCs prosodically and morphologically integrated?
#### **Recent work:**  
  - Malayalam doesn't need adpositions: the case of vP-adjunction. [WCCFL 42 abstract](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uhb6RaOGk1RqL_0GqmvN5o9yj94F6Kdj/view)
  - Linear asymmetries and the syntax of serialization: against an antisymmetric approach. [ConSOLE 32 Proceedings](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/binaries/content/assets/geesteswetenschappen/lucl/sole/console-xxxii_updated.pdf#page=238)

### **Locality and constraints on transformations/redundancies**  
#### **Research questions:**
  - To what extent are non-complements (specifiers and adjuncts) opaque or transparent?  
  - How can we derive cross-linguistic variation in, e.g., left-branch extraction and successive cyclic movement patterns?  
#### **Recent work:**  
  - A timing approach to escape hatch dependencies. [GLOW 47 Abstract](https://link-url-here.org)


### **Conventionalization of directive markers in sign languages**    
#### **Research questions:**
  - What strategies do **sign languages** use to mark directives, and how do such strategy evolve?  
  - What is the distribution of labour between syntax, semantics, and pragmatics in these constructions?
#### **Recent work:**  
  - The grammaticalization of a motion verb into an imperative marker in two sign languages. [FEAST 6 Proceedings](https://doi.org/10.31009/FEAST.i6.04)


### **Quantification and information structure**  (joint work with Zeqi Zhao)
#### **Research questions:**
  - What are the strategies used in **Mandarin** to express universal(-ish) quantification, and what is the role of _dou_ in the morphology/syntax/semantics?  
  - What are the effects of _dou_-related movement on scope and/or information structure in Mandarin? 
  <!-- #### **Current Work:**   -->

<!-- ## Methodological Approach
My research integrates **formal theoretical modeling** with **empirical data collection**, including:
- **Comparative Syntax**: Testing predictions of syntactic theory across typologically diverse languages.
- **Corpus-Based Studies**: Analyzing spontaneous data from spoken and sign languages.
- **Elicitation & Fieldwork**: Gathering primary linguistic data from underdocumented languages.
- **Experimental Approaches**: Incorporating insights from psycholinguistics on structural processing. -->

<!-- ## Ongoing & Future Projects
- A formal account of **serial verb constructions in head-final languages**.
- Developing a **typology of imperative markers** in **sign languages**.
- Investigating the **syntax-prosody mapping** of complex predicates. -->
