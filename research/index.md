# Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **theoretical syntax** and its interfaces with **phonology, morphology, semantics, and pragmatics**. I investigate how syntactic dependencies interact with other grammatical modules, with a special forcus on **cross-linguistic** and **cross-modal** data (i.e. from **spoken and sign languages**).

## General theoretical focus

### _Syntactic dependencies and locality_  
  I examine the structural conditions that regulate transformations, agreement, and other kinds of redundant dependencies, with a focus on how locality effects emerge from the inherent organization of the memory in syntax, rather than through ancillary mechanisms (CED, phases, etc.).

### _Cross-linguistic variation and typology_  
  Investigating how syntactic structures differ across languages and what these differences reveal about combinatory principles of grammar.

### _Interfaces between syntax and other modules_  
  I seek to understand how the interactions between syntax and phonology, semantics, and pragmatics determines well-formedness, interpretation, and prosodic realization.



## Empirical domains and ongoing projects

### _Serial verb constructions (SVCs)_  

#### **Research questions:**
  * How do SVCs challenge existing models of syntactic hierarchy and argument structure?  
  * What patterns distinguish SVCs in **Malayalam** and other **head-final** languages?
  * How are SVCs prosodically and morphologically integrated?

#### **Recent work:**  
  * Malayalam doesn't need adpositions: the case of vP-adjunction. [WCCFL 42 abstract](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uhb6RaOGk1RqL_0GqmvN5o9yj94F6Kdj/view)
  * Linear asymmetries and the syntax of serialization: against an antisymmetric approach. [ConSOLE 32 Proceedings](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/binaries/content/assets/geesteswetenschappen/lucl/sole/console-xxxii_updated.pdf#page=238)

### _Locality and constraints on transformations/redundancies_  

#### **Research questions:**
  * To what extent are non-complements (specifiers and adjuncts) opaque or transparent?  
  * How can we derive cross-linguistic variation in, e.g., left-branch extraction and successive cyclic movement patterns?  

#### **Recent work:**  
  * A timing approach to escape hatch dependencies. [GLOW 47 Abstract](https://glowlinguistics.org/47/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/02/Ottur.pdf)


### _Conventionalization of directive markers in sign languages_ (joint work with Marianthi Koraka and the G√∂ttingen SignLab)    

#### **Research questions:**
  * What strategies do **sign languages** use to mark directives, and how do such strategies evolve?  
  * What is the distribution of labour between syntax, semantics, and pragmatics in these constructions?

#### **Recent work:**  
  * The grammaticalization of a motion verb into an imperative marker in two sign languages. [FEAST 6 Proceedings](https://doi.org/10.31009/FEAST.i6.04)


### _Quantification and clausal structure in Mandarin_  (joint work with Zeqi Zhao)

#### **Research questions:**
  * What are the strategies used in **Mandarin** to express universal(-ish) quantification, and what is the role of _dou_ in the morphology/syntax/semantics?  
  * What are the effects of _dou_-related movement on scope and/or information structure in Mandarin?
